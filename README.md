# tjacli

A small Haskell library that can parse and write tja files

## Usage

There is none. The commands don't exist yet.

## Background

.tja files are taiko chart files. Having a parser and writer for these can help with many things such as:
- Creating charts
- Converting charts to other file formats
- Auto generating charts

### Why Haskell?
Mainly cause I wanna learn how to properly use IO monads and general Haskell syntax. Also, I plan on using this in another project that will run serverside, and so having an effective cli tool that can interface with other programs for that would be nice.
